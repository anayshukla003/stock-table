# TODO List for Making Stock Dashboard More Professional and Human-Like

- [x] Update index.html: Add more meta tags, favicon, and improve semantic HTML structure.
- [x] Update styles.css: Enhance color scheme, add responsiveness, improve animations and shadows for a polished look.
- [x] Update script.js: Add error handling for data fetch, include human-like comments, improve code readability and add minor optimizations.
- [x] Update stocks.json: Add more sample data to make it more realistic and comprehensive.
- [x] Test the dashboard: Open index.html in browser to verify functionality, appearance, and ensure no AI detection cues.
